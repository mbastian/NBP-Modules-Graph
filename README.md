#**NBP-Modules-Graph** - Netbeans Platform Modules Graph

A Netbeans Plug-in to get the graph of dependencies between Netbeans Platform modules in DOT format.

A Netbeans Platform project has a set of modules that depends on each other. This plug-in allows to visualize the dependency graph easily by creating a DOT file. The result file can be opened in GraphViz (http://graphviz.org) or Gephi (http://gephi.org).

##How to use it

1. Install the Netbeans plug-in in Netbeans 6.9 or later. The NBM file is located in the 'dist' folder.
2. A new menu item is available when you right-click on a Netbeans Platform project. Click on 'Modules graph...'.
3. The plug-in asks if libraries should be included. Choose 'Yes' to also include Netbeans modules or 'No' otherwise.
4. Select the folder where to save the result file.

Then, open this file with a graph visualizion software to see the result.
